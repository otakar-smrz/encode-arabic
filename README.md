## New things

- Encode Arabic now uses [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) to provide example-driven insights and documentation. Check out the [IHaskell](Haskell/Encode/README.ipynb) and [IPython](Python/Encode/README.ipynb) notebooks!

- The project includes the recently updated [LaTeX](LaTeX) packages [acolor](LaTeX/acolor) and [alocal](LaTeX/alocal) for fancy coloring of the Arabic script and extending the virtues of the ArabTeX notation.

- The [Haskell](Haskell/Encode) library has fixed the typesetting of wasla and quoting of vowels in the [phonological transcription](Haskell/Encode/Encode/Arabic/ArabTeX/ZDMG.hs).

- There is support for calling the Haskell executables from within [Python](Python/Encode) as if they were [native functions](Python/Encode/README.ipynb).

- Both Haskell and [Perl](Perl/Encode) libraries now support the [Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter](Haskell/Encode/Encode/Arabic/Habash.hs) transliteration scheme, next to many others. Check out our [web service](http://otakar-smrz.github.io/encode-arabic).

## Join us

Since [Encode Arabic](http://github.com/otakar-smrz/encode-arabic) is now hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/otakar-smrz), it becomes yet easier to join the project and contribute to it. We do need new features, applications, as well as documentation. Feel free to contact us or clone the project!
